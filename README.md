## Project Name
This project is called * [Ping Pong](https://ericwanjohi.github.io/Ping/)
### Specifications of the Project
The program accepts a number and displays:
* "ping" if the number is divisible by 3
* "pong" if the number is divisible by 5
* "pingpong" if the number is divisible by 15

Therefore I needed a form to accept the user input and validate it's a number.
Store that number in a variable and then create a loop to check for the specs above.
